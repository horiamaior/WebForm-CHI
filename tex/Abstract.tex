  UPDATED---\today. This sample paper describes the formatting
  requirements for SIGCHI conference proceedings, and offers
  recommendations on writing for the worldwide SIGCHI
  readership. Please review this document even if you have submitted
  to SIGCHI conferences before, as some format details have changed
  relative to previous years. Abstracts should be about 150 words and
