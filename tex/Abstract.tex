	The study aimed to improve the web form filling process and produce implications for design. In order, to provide generalisable results we tested 3 different layouts of a insurance claim web form. We tested dividing a standard web form into 3 separate web pages, and putting the description box at the beginning instead of the end of the form. Because it is suggested by usability design heuristics that workload should be reduced as much as possible we decided to obtain both objective and subjective inferences about workload. We used functional near infrared spectroscopy(fNIRS) as objective measure, and NASA-TLX as subjective. The result showed that the divided page web form yielded the highest workload, while the standard single paged web form the least. We have discussed the results and provided implications for design. In addition, fNIRS practicality for evaluation of web form interfaces was assessed as limited.
